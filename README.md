# Brain_Networks_Protocol-BNP-
The world today is full of violence. Children face daily horror experiences, especially in conflict and war zones. How is the future going to look like? Hundreds of lives are destroyed due to traumatic memories. In a human brain, Network patterns or connected dots represent memory data. Brain Network Protocol (BNP) studies the possibility of how we can get access to human memory network patterns to identify traumatic memory patterns.
